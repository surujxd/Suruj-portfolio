    "reasoning": "Based on the user's request to remove the contact form and instead showcase their business contact email, the data structure is simplified. We remove the `contact_messages` collection and any related admin features. Since there's no data to be stored, a simple placeholder document indicating the contact email address can be used if required. If no data persistence is required at all, Firestore may not even be needed. However, this response still models the data persistence option using the firestore paths as requested, the recommendation is to have an owner-based structure under `/users/{userId}/contactInfo`."
